This project was an experiment to use Python to read an external JSON file. It is a simple games list of the games that I have finished so far in 2025. 

The files in this project:

- games_list.json - this is the actual JSON file.
- games_list.py - this is the main Python file that runs the program.
- games_reader.py - this class actually reads the JSON file and then converts it into a Single Game class.
- single_game.py - this class is a Python class of the JSON game.

This project was a learning project and not really meant to be used for anything properly.
